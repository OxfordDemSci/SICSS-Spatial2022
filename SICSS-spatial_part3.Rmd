# Practical exercises

See below three practical exercises. Please choose the one you are most interested in. In case you are quick, try the remaining exercises. 

1. Add a variable for the distance to Boris Johnson's home (10 Downing St, London SW1A 2AB, UK). 

    * You could either find the coordinates manually or you use `tmaptools` function `geocode_OSM()` to query OpenStreetMaps API for geo-coding. 
    
    * There are also Google Maps APIs like `ggmap` or `mapsapi` but they require registration.
    

2. Please think about other potential variables you could add to the previous data which might be relevant for predicting NO2.

  * You can for instance use the census API, or the OpenStreetMap API.
  
  * You can also search for other data in the [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/cultural-infrastructure-map).     
    

3. Given you have added new data, can you use some model to predict the importance of single variables for predicting NO2 levels across London?
